# MP-SP_mapSwitcher
A GTA V mod that allows to load and unload the multiplayer map on singleplayer mode.
To customize the key and the initial state (MP map loaded/unloaded), use the MP_MapSwitch.ini file.

## Installation
Place the MP_MapSwitch.dll and MP_MapSwitch.ini in the /scripts folder.

## Dependencies
- ScriptHookV
- ScriptHookVDotNet2

## Use
Press the designated key in MP_MapSwitch.ini ("k" by default) to alternate between singleplayer or multiplayer map.

## Compatibility Issues
Other mods that load the MP map can cause minor bugs (like desynchronize the load variable, nothing too serious).

When MP map is loaded, it can cause visual glitches with map modifications (such as Forests of San Andreas). 
These will persist until you restart the game with the multiplayer map unloaded (in single player map mode)."
